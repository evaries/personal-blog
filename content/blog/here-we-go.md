title: Minimalism
description: And how it can change your life
---
Just take a look at this single quote and think a little about it. If you dive deeply into this phrase, it can change your life. 

> *"We buy things we don't need for money we don't have to impress people we don't like" (c) Fight Club*

Minimalism is not about minimum things around you, it about things, which just have a sense and value in your life.
